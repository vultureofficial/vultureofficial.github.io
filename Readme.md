# HackUntu Operating system
> version 0.1

## background
- ### what is HackUntu?
- >> HackUntu is an [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) based [linux](https://www.kernel.org) distro that aims to achieve the same userbility as [Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/).
- >> The system uses most of the features from ubuntu (such as gnome-apps) but removes office applications (libre etc).
- >> HackUntu uses Ubuntus default package manager (**apt** and **apt-get**).
- >> HackUntu is made for ethical computing (**password penetration, etc**), even though it can be used as a general purpose system 


## Roadmap
- [x] network support
- [x] Update the website
- [x] Contact the media


## Problems 
- >> apt and apt-get cannot install **ALL** packages. Common linux distro packages cannot be installed via **apt** or **apt-get**. We recommend building them from source.
